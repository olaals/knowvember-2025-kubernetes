# Wrapping up

Good job learning the basics of Kubernetes!

There are still many things we did not cover

- The hacky port mapping should have been an [ingress resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) (tls, https)
- Network policy
- ConfigMap
- Secret
- Resource limits & requests
- Persistent Volumes & Claims
- and more

Not overwhelmed yet ? Take a look at [CNCF landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/)

If you want to practice some more Kubernetes have a look at the free 
tasks at [killercoda](https://killercoda.com/killer-shell-ckad)
